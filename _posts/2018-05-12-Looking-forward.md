Today I got the result for my final semester at IIT Kanpur. This ends my coursework at IITK (not necessarily my stay thought :) ). There 
is a lot to look back on, memories and regrets but let's walk down this lane some other time. There is a lot to look forward to for the
summer. I will be focusing on that for this post.

I am looking forward to my visit to US during June. I have to present my paper as part of the proceedings of 1st Value Prediction
Championship which is co-located with ISCA 2018. I am also very lucky in this regards as the first ever conference that I will be
attending will be hosting this year's Turing Lecture to be given by award winners John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson.


I am also looking forward to working with the Linux Graphics community as part of my GSoC. I had almost given up the idea of doing GSoC this
summer until I found this project. I always wanted to contribute to Linux and this was a golden opportunity to do so. I jumped at
opportunity and started my application. I completed my application within a week. My previous experience with Graphics community helped me
in getting this project. 


I haven't been blogging for a while now, due to the semester load and my new found love for anime (I am listening to a japanese song while writing this and I have no idea what it means :P). When I looked at the archive section I realised that I only have 3 blog posts for the year 2017. Hopefully it will be better this year (though the start of the year is not as promising as it should be), because this time I am doing GSoC which in a way forces me to write a blog post every once in a while.
